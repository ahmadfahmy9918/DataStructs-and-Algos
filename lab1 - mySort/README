mySort has two paramaters - the array which we are required to sort, as well as 
total number of values stored in the array. By using a method to find the total length, we can 
determine the first number, and store that accordingly, then the last number while also storing that. 
By using these stored values, we can then call upon the betterSort method in mySort and utilize
it.
