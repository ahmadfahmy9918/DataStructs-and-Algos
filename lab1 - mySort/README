Answer: In-order to implement the better sort method, one needs to realize what the actual signature 
of the mySort. The mySort has two paramaters - the array which we are required to sort, as well as 
total number of values stored in the array. By using a method to find the total lenght, we can 
determine the first number, and store that arrdoingly,and the last number and also storing that. 
By using these values stored, we can then call upon the betterSort method in the mySort and utilize
it.
