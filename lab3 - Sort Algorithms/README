#1 Brief Summary
  The insertionSort algorithm was implemented by using a simple few lines of code
  to compare and swap 3 integers that were used to scroll through all the
  user-inputted data. Furthermore, MergeSort was implemented by using the "divide and
  conquer" approach whcih splits the user-inputted data into smaller chunks and sorts
  them, then brings them together and sorts the pre-sorted chunks as they get larger
  in larger which mathematically results in faster computation times.


#2 Analysis
  Insertion Sort
    average & worst case: O(n^2)
    Best Case: O(n)

  Merge sort
    Average, best, and worst case: O(n * Log(n))
